# Python basics 

Interactive materials consisting of Jupyter notebooks running online on the Binder server with the following kernels: SageMath, Python, R, Julia, Octave, JavaScript. 

Three ways of browsing/downloading files in this repository:

* Click the icon [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gajdosandrej/python_basics.git/HEAD) to launch the interactive repository.  The first launch may take up to several minutes (this may also happen at other times when the servers are overloaded). After the interactive repository (all its directories) is loaded, the file index_python_basics needs to be opened and there you can browse/run/download the materials for the various Python components. Or you can directly go to jupyter_notebooks directory and from there you can launch particular Jupyter notebooks. 


* Click the icon [![nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/design/blob/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.org/github/gajdosandrej/python_basics/blob/main/index_python_basics.ipynb?flush_cache=true) to start viewing/downloading Jupyter notebooks in static mode using nbviewer.  


* Specific files (Jupyter notebooks, pdf, ...) can be viewed in static mode or downloaded directly here from the GitHub repository. In this case, the formatting quality of the displayed Jupyter notebooks may be different (worse) from the original one. 


Happy discovering, experimenting and studying! :-)
